![sales_analyst_logo](https://github.com/hazeedhrshd/Competitor-Analysis-of-Deliverando/assets/129052112/b8f4aa50-abde-43fd-a5bc-0f9f3295b8b4)

This repository contains an analysis of competitor and growth trends for Deliverando, a newly opened food delivery company in the city of Graz. The analysis involves data cleaning and wrangling using Python's pandas library and visualizations using Plotly, a powerful Python library for interactive and visually appealing plots. Please note that all data used in this analysis is entirely fictional and anonymous to respect privacy reasons.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is entirely synthetic and generated for illustrative purposes only. It includes anonymized information about affliated restaurents, food delivery orders, competitor data, and various performance metrics. No real customer data or sensitive information has been used in this analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Wrangling

The data cleaning and wrangling processes were conducted using Python's pandas library to ensure the data's accuracy and consistency. The main tasks involved in this process were:

- Loading and merging data from different sources.
- Handling missing or null values.
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant data.
- Data transformation and aggregation to prepare it for analysis.
- Identifying and resolving data inconsistencies.

The code for data cleaning and wrangling can be found in the `data_cleaning.ipynb` notebook in this repository.

## Data Visualization with Plotly

To provide a comprehensive analysis, interactive and visually engaging visualizations were created using Plotly. Plotly offers a range of charts and graphs, including line charts, bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps, to help understand and explore the data effectively.

The visualizations in this analysis focus on the following key aspects:

1. **Competitor Analysis:** Comparing Deliverando's performance with other food delivery services in Graz. This includes metrics such as delivery times, customer ratings, and order volume.

2. **Growth Analysis:** Tracking Deliverando's growth over two months, including order volume trends.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Deliverado!!!.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data cleaning and wrangling code using pandas and Plotly visualizations and insights.

## Usage

To replicate the data cleaning and wrangling process and explore the visualizations:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running `pip install pandas plotly`.
3. Run the `Deliverado!!!.ipynb` notebook to perform data cleaning, wrangling and explore the interactive Plotly visualizations.
